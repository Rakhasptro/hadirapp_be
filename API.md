# HadirApp - API Reference

This document lists the backend HTTP endpoints implemented in the repository (NestJS controllers).

Base URL: `http://{HOST}:{PORT}/api` (adjust according to your deployment). The controllers shown here map to paths below the API base.

> Note: Many endpoints require JWT authentication (see `JwtAuthGuard`) and role-based access (`RolesGuard`). When `Auth` is required the header is `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Notes & Next Steps
- This file is generated by scanning controller decorators. Some method-level guards, request/response DTOs and exact response shapes are defined in services and DTO files — consult `hadir_be/src/modules/*` for details on body schemas and validation.
- If you want, I can:
  - Expand this file with example request/response JSON for each endpoint (I can infer shapes from DTOs and services),
  - Generate a Postman collection or OpenAPI spec based on the code,
  - Create a smaller `API_OVERVIEW.md` or split per-module API files.
